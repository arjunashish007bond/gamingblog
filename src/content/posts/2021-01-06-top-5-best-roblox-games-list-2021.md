## List Of Top 5 Best Roblox Games :-

### **1.NATURAL DISASTER SURVIVAL[](<>)**

![NATURAL DISASTER SURVIVAL](/assets/roblox-games-natural-disaster-survival.jpg "NATURAL DISASTER SURVIVAL")

Natural Disaster Survival includes a clue to PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Prepare to desperately dodge the elements for life in any shelter you can find. At least, that's how we play PUBG.

In this Roblox game, they may not be fighting, but they will try to protect themselves from various natural disasters which are explicitly designed to kill them.

On our first tour we had to climb a glass tower to escape a flash flood. Then on another turn on the same map we fired again and found that an earthquake had taken us away from all the tall buildings. Show the dissolution of our avatar in many parts.

### **2.WORK AT A PIZZA PLACE**

This one is definitely for fans of cooking games. If working for a pizza company were this fun, we'd be clearing our desks for the nearest Pizza Hut in no time. Work at a Pizza Place is a Roblox game that invites you to work with Builder Brothers' Pizza to realize your understandable dream of being a cashier, cook, boxer (not so) and delivery man.

Playing with the first three jobs is pretty much fun, but as a rude cashier, you'll have most fun laughing at your customers' humorous outrage. Once you're done with pesky pizza lovers, you can test out the surprisingly solid driving mechanics by delivering customer orders to their doorstep a few doors back from your property.

That brings us to the other half of the job at a pizzeria: not a pizzeria. Like the Sims, outside of work, you use your hard-earned paycheck to add value to your home. However, if you track down a specific portal, you will be teleported to "Party Island," a parallel environment where you can let your greasy hair fall on Justin Bieber's "Despacito" and other songs. Who knew pizzerias had it that good?

### **3. JAILBREAK**

Jailbreak is as close as Roblox games in the world of GTA 5 RP. You first choose one of two roles: police officer or criminal. If you choose the latter, your Michael Schofield dream will come true by escaping Her Majesty's pleasure. Or you can spend the rest of your days in the cafeteria and jump on the trampolines in the back yard, which is fun too.

In order to escape, you'll need a key card that your kidnappers would prefer not to have. Anyone familiar with Fallout and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim will know how the pickpocket mechanic works in this Roblox game.

### **4.  THEME PARK TYCOON 2**

![THEME PARK TYCOON 2](/assets/theme-park-tycoon-2.jpg "THEME PARK TYCOON 2")

Many Roblox games are "tycoon" simulations or management games, but the Tycoon 2 theme park is one of the best. After a short and simple tutorial, you will have your large expanse of land that you can use to create your own Disneyland experiment.

The user interface is streamlined with a good range of options, but not too much to be overwhelming. As you'd expect, the goal is to create a theme park that will appeal to your attendees as the number increases, and therefore your budget as well.

Attention is paid to details here: you need to make sure you have enough trash cans and other gear to keep your guests happy and keep your park spotless. If you fail to meet your health obligations, you need to be prepared for a lot of trash covering the floor. It's not that much fun and it's a roller coaster ride to be a theme park designer.

Leaderboards, common to all Roblox games, encourage light competition to keep you going. With your online competitors' money and the number of diners constantly chasing the corner of your screen, you will be asked to keep chasing the theme park of your dreams. You may not be able to create the crazy parks you find in games like Planet Coaster, but Theme Park Tycoon is a Roblox game well worth your time.



### **5. SPEED RUN 4**

![SPEED RUN 4](/assets/speed-run-4.jpg "SPEED RUN 4")

Speed Run 4 is a classic fast-shooting platformer game perfect for short lunch breaks. Once you've crossed the start line, you'll automatically be put into sprint mode. Your objective is to go through each of the 31 levels as fast as possible, with no surprises.

It's simple, yes, but the level design is as versatile as the soundtrack. On one map you could dive into psychedelic trance on light purple rigs, while the next could be pure white, uh, Coldplay's speed of sound as a background track - why not?

But don't let that put you off: as with many Roblox games, Speed Run 4 really makes sense with friends. It's pretty fun going through each level on your solitaire level, but racing against your fellow Robloxes adds another dimension to this fast paced platform game.
